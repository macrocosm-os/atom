Just as the atom forms the basis of all matter, this repository will serve as the core structure for every project that follows. Scalable, efficient, and adaptable, `atom` provides a framework that enables rapid development while ensuring stability and clarity for bittensor subnetworks. 

The current vision of this sdk is to provide us with a backbone that all of us can benefit from, such as:
1. Generic miner backbone 
2. Generic validator backbone 
3. Chain-related tools (writing, reading)
4. Organic Scoring tools

Organic queries to the subnetwork refer to jobs input by users/customers. To facilitate the eventual productization of these subnetworks, it is important that we have the famework to support organic interactions, allowing their seamless integration into the miner-validator flow.

## Working with Atom
If you want to use it for your subnet development, you can install using: 
```
pip install git+https://github.com/macrocosm-os/atom.git@main
```

If you want to work in developer mode where changes to the codebase will become reflected in your subnet, without needing to re-pip install, use the following: 
```bash
git clone ... 
pip install -e PATH_TO_ATOM
```
The -e allows you to be in "edit" mode. 

## Poetry Installation
We use poetry to handle dependancies that are within `atom`. 

### MacOS 
```bash 
brew install python@3.11
bash install.sh
```
